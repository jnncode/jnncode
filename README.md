I'm J, or [jnncode](https://www.jnncode.com), a software engineer and designer from Minneapolis, Minnesota. :dragon:

My interests lies in science and technology that are influenced by industry-leading products and services of large scales.

Outside of it all, I venture off with my camera and capture small glimpses of life. I also play a lot of video games and stream it every so often.
